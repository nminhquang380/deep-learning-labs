# TODO Task 1b - Implement LesionDataset
#        You must implement the __init__, __len__ and __getitem__ methods.
#
#        The __init__ function should have the following prototype
#          def __init__(self, img_dir, labels_fname):
#            - img_dir is the directory path with all the image files
#            - labels_fname is the csv file with image ids and their 
#              corresponding labels
#
#        Note: You should not open all the image files in your __init__.
#              Instead, just read in all the file names into a list and
#              open the required image file in the __getitem__ function.
#              This prevents the machine from running out of memory.
#
# TODO Task 1e - Add augment flag to LesionDataset, so the __init__ function
#                now look like this:
#                   def __init__(self, img_dir, labels_fname, augment=False):
#

class LesionDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    pass
