"""
Welcome to the TextDataset class! This is a pretty standard PyTorch Dataset class,
except that it also reads a text classification CSV from disk and tokenizes it.

The class takes three init arguments:
    path: the path of the CSV to read
    max_sequence_len: the maximum number of tokens for any example

You need fill in missing parts inside the __init__ function to tokenize the texts.
We will set truncation and padding to True, so all of the tokenised inputs are of 
the same length,filled with zeros where necessary. 
You will need to pass the max_sequence_len parameter into the tokenizer so the
tokenizer knows when it needs to truncate the input.


**Fill in the TODOs in the __init__ function**

You will also need to complete the __getitem__ function. This should grab the 
example and label for the given index, initialise a tensor for each, and return
them.

**Fill in the TODOs in the __getitem__ function**

When you're finished, return to the "Write the Dataset Class" section of the notebook.
